<h1>:pencil: Description</h1>
<p>Meet Your Classmates is an Instagram-clone and hub where students can get to know and relate to their peers via completion of short 3-question mini-surveys. By learning about others' backgrounds, previous experiences, and interests, an atmosphere of community is created that is conducive to higher levels of learning and success.</p>
Instructions
Note:	Integrate styling with <h1 align="center"> to center text.
Note:	Add your deployed link directly to the top here - many users won't scroll all the way down to find it.
Note:	Use emojis by typing in :emojiname: Ex. :school: ---> üè´
While emojis show automatically on GitHub, to see them on VS Code one needs to install an extension like Markdown Emoji. Some emojis may also look completely different on VS Code than GitHub.
Check out this full list of available GitHub emojis.

| Description | Screenshot|
|-------------|-----------|
| caption | image |
Note:	Whatever is placed in between <details></details> will be hidden beneath a closed drop-down menu, until its arrow is clicked on. The title for this should be placed in between <summary></summary>.
Note:	To have a drop-down menu display by default without the user having to click it, add the word 'open' to the details tag.
Ex. <details> --> <details open>
Note:	Image dimensions can also be resized by specifying width and height.
Ex. <img src="" width="300" height="400">
